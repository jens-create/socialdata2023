<h2 id="investigating-the-factors-that-contribute-to-accidents">Investigating the factors that contribute to accidents</h2>

<p>Crashes on NYC streets are caused by various factors, some of which are more obvious than others. It could be a driver’s distraction, fatigue, or even aggressive behavior. Pedestrians who jaywalk or cyclists who ride recklessly can also contribute to crashes.</p>

<p>This section will explore the different factors that contribute to accidents and how they are related to each other. We will also look at how these factors have changed over time. That way, we can better understand what causes crashes and how we can prevent them from happening in the future.</p>

<h3 id="the-most-common-factors-that-contribute-to-accidents">The most common factors that contribute to accidents</h3>

<p>The following chart shows the top 10 factors that contribute to accidents in NYC. The data is based on the latest dataset from NYC Open Data, which contains information about all traffic accidents reported by the NYPD since 2012.</p>

<p><img src="images/top10_factors.png" alt="Top 10 contributing factors to accidents" /> TODO: Insert image</p>

<p>As you can see, the most common factor is “Driver Inattention/Distraction”, followed by “Failure to Yield Right-of-Way” and “Backing Unsafely”. These three factors account for more than half of all accidents in NYC.</p>
