    "## Part 2: Reading about the theory of visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we can go deeper with the visualization this year, we are going to read the first couple of chapters from [*Data Analysis with Open Source Tools*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596802363.do) (DAOST). It's pretty old, but I think it's a fantastic resource and one that is pretty much as relevant now as it was back then. The author is a physicist (like Sune) so he likes the way he thinks. And the books takes the reader all the way from visualization, through modeling to computational mining. Anywho - it's a great book and well worth reading in its entirety. \n",

    "> * The author of DAOST (Philipp Janert) likes KDEs (and think they're better than histograms). And we don't. Sune didn't give a detailed explanation in the video, but now that works to our advantage. We'll ask you to think about this and thereby create an excellent exercise: When can KDEs be misleading? \n",
    "> * Sune discussed some strengths of the CDF - there are also weaknesses. Janert writes \"CDFs have less intuitive appeal than histograms of KDEs\". What does he mean by that?\n",
    "> * What is a *Quantile plot*? What is it good for. \n",
    "> * How is a *Probablity plot* defined? What is it useful for? Have you ever seen one before?\n",
    "> * One of the reasons we like DAOST is that Janert is so suspicious of mean, median, and related summary statistics. Explain why one has to be careful when using those - and why visualization of the full data is always better. \n",
    "> * Sune loves box plots (but not enough to own one of [these](https://images.app.goo.gl/rpozyRX3xu5oFobt8) ðŸ˜‚). When are box plots most useful?\n",
    "> * The book doesn't mention [violin plots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_plot). Are those better or worse than box plots? Why?\n",
    "> * Remember the box-plot part from [this video from last time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbJyPELmhJc) (the part that starts at 0:56)? Explain in your own words how this video illustrates potential issues even with box-plots? Do violin-plots help with that issue?"

    "> *Excercise Part 1*: Connecting the dots and recreating plots from DAOST but using our own favorite dataset.\n",
    "> * Let's make a jitter-plot (that is, code up something like **Figure 2-1** from DAOST from scratch), but based on *SF Police data*. My hunch from inspecting the file is that the police-folks might be a little bit lazy in noting down the **exact** time down to the second. So choose a crime-type and a suitable time interval (somewhere between a month and 6 months depending on the crime-type) and create a jitter plot of the arrest times during a single hour (like 13-14, for example). So let time run on the $x$-axis and create vertical jitter.\n",
    "> * Last time, we did lots of bar-plots. Today, we'll play around with histograms (creating two crime-data based versions of the plot-type shown in DAOST **Figure 2-2**). I think the GPS data could be fun to see this way. \n",
    ">   * This time, pick two crime-types with different geographical patterns **and** a suitable time-interval for each (you want between 1000 and 10000 points in your histogram)\n",
    ">   * Then take the latitude part of the GPS coordinates for each crime and bin the latitudes so that you have around 50 bins across the city of SF. You can use your favorite method for binning. I like `numpy.histogram`. This function gives you the counts and then you do your own plotting. \n",
    "> * Next up is using the plot-type shown in **Figure 2-4** from DAOST, but with the data you used to create Figure 2.1. There is not a single great way to create kernel density plots in Python. [Here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/density-plots-with-pandas-in-python/), you'll finde a pandas based strategy, but you can also use `gaussian_kde` from `scipy.stats` ([for an example, check out this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4150171/how-to-create-a-density-plot-in-matplotlib)) or you can use [`seaborn.kdeplot`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.kdeplot.html). There is also another nice tutorial for KDE plots [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/histograms-and-density-plots-in-python-f6bda88f5ac0).\n",
    "> * Now grab 25 random timepoints from the dataset (of 1000-10000 original data) you've just plotted and create a version of Figure 2-4 based on the 25 data points. Does this shed light on why I think KDEs can be misleading? \n",

You can read about it and learn how to install it [here](https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/).\n",

    "That means that we can easily draw on the fact that the crime data has lots of exciting geo-data attached. The map we're going to be creating is called a **[choropleth map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map)** (more on these later), which is basically a map, where we color in shapefiles (more on this below) based on some value that we care about. We'll take our inspiration from Plotly's gentle intro to [Choropleth maps](https://plotly.com/python/mapbox-county-choropleth/)\n",

    "> [Shapefiles can have many different formats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile). Because we are brilliant teachers and an all-round standup people, we are sharing the shapefiles as [`geojson`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoJSON), which is an easy-to-use format for shapefiles based on `json`.\n",

    "> * Now that you have the shapefiles, you can follow the example here: https://plotly.com/python/mapbox-county-choropleth/ but with the following modifications:\n",
    ">    * In the example the `id` is a so-called FIPS code. In our case the `id` is the `DISTRICT`\n",
    ">    * You will have to convert the dictionary of random values I included above to a Pandas dataframe with the right column headings.\n",
    ">    * The data used in the example has a range between zero and 12. Your data is between $[0,1]$. So you'll need to modify the plotting command to accound for that change.\n",
    ">    * You should also change the map to display the right zoom level.\n",
    ">    * And the map should center on San Francisco's `lat` and `lon`.\n",
