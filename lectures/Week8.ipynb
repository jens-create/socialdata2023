    "* The web-page should be hosted on your GitHub Pages site (Week 7).\n",
    "* The format must be the classic *Magazine Genre* presented on a single web-page (see the Segel \\& Heer paper for details.\n",
    "* The story should have a brief introduction to the dataset so new readers from outside the class can understand what's going on.\n",
    "* Your story should include three visualizations. Not more than three, not less than three (but multi-panel figures are OK). The figures should be one of each of the following types\n",
    "  - One time-series / bar chart (it's OK to use the \"fancy\" plot-typs like calendar plots or polar bar-charts from Week 2, Part 4).\n",
    "  - One map (use techniques from Week 3 and 4)\n",
    "  - One interactive visualization in Bokeh (Week 6)\n",
    "* **At a minimum, the Bokeh visualization should contain different data** than the exercise we did for Week 6 (it's a plus if it's a new type of viz altogether). \n",
    "* The two other visualization may be repetitions of figures created during the previous lectures, or they may be new.\n",
    "* Make the figures nice. Specifically:\n",
    "  - Aim to make the figures visually consistent (color, fonts, etc)\n",
    "  - Follow the recommendations from my video on nice figures (Week 2)\n",
    "* In terms of the amount of text, I envision something like 500-1500 words (including figure captions).\n",
    "* It is a plus if you can back up some of your findings with external sources, such as news stories from the area, looking up which building is located at some set of `lat,lon` coordinates, or similar. (So when you see something happening at some time/place in the data, see if you can understand it more deeply by investigating outside the dataset.)"
