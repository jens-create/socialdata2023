    "This week we're going to try something a little bit different. We're going to set up a website on GitHub. The reason we're doing this is the web is a much more natural format for data visualization than static forms like paper. Online, you can make visualizations interactive and you can create more complex narrative structures around your visualizations.\n",

    "In the past, I used to think that creating a website was something everyone could simply do. But it's been a pain-point for many students, so this year I decided to simply make the website creation an exercise that we do in class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below you'll find a tutorial optimized for you all. I've chosen to use GitHub pages https://pages.github.com in combination with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) since everything is open source, [MarkDown](https://www.markdownguide.org)-based, and free. And as an added benefit, you need to learn how to use Git in order to get the page going. \n",
