    "\n",
    "Different encodings have varying strengths and limitations, which can impact how effectively data is conveyed and interpreted by viewers. The effectiveness of an encoding can be influenced by factors such as data complexity, visualization goals, and audience characteristics. Therefore, it's important to carefully consider encodings when designing visualizations, and to choose appropriate encodings.\n",
    "\n",
    "During Lecture 1, a bar chart was used to visualize the yearly frequency of a particular type of crime throughout the data period of 2003-2017. The bar chart was an effective choice for conveying this information, as it allowed the audience to easily observe and understand the development of the crime frequency over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "During Lecture 2, we visualized an enriched version of the same crime frequency data using a calendar plot. The calendar plot displayed the daily frequency of the crime type, and utilized additional encodings, such as color, to represent the frequency. By using color in addition to the position of each day on the calendar, the calendar plot allowed for a more nuanced and detailed understanding of the daily fluctuations in crime frequency over time. This would not have been easily conveyed using a bar chart.\n",

    "- Angle: Differences in angle can be difficult to accurately perceive and compare, especially when they are small or subtle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Color intensity: Color intensity can be challenging to accurately perceive and compare due to factors such as variations in lighting conditions and individual biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Area: Differences in area can be challenging to accurately perceive and compare when they are small or subtle, and can be easily distorted by visual cues such as shading or texture. Additionally, scaling areas appropriately can be difficult in some cases. This is a bit similar to angles.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example where the angle encoding is used is the pie chart in the [medium](https://medium.com/the-mission/to-pie-charts-3b1f57bcb34a) article which describes poor visualizations and in particular why pie charts should not be used.\n",

    "The pie chart shows the proportions of different animals in a population. The visualisation is supposed to convey the proporiton of the animals, however, this is very difficult to comprehend.

This is because the human eye can have difficulty accurately perceiving and comparing differences in angles, especially when the differences are small or subtle.
